# GIMP-Tools

So this very simply just takes an image and for all layers in the image, puts them into their own individual folder, to better process them individually.  Currently, the code leaves a remnant of a Group 0 with an empty layer, I'll fix it when I get tired of it.  Otherwise, it works as itended.  As a forewarning, this will process all open files, as I could not find a more direct approach to selecting the image file, so only open files you intend to folderize.
